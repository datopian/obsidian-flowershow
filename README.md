# ðŸŒ· Obsidian Flowershow Plugin

## Development

### Local testing

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Create symlinks to the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files in your Obsidian plugins folder:

``` sh
ln -s /path/to/obsidian-flowershow/main.js /path/to/obsidian-vault/.obsidian/plugins/flowershow/main.js
ln -s /path/to/obsidian-flowershow/manifest.json /path/to/obsidian-vault/.obsidian/plugins/flowershow/manifest.json
ln -s /path/to/obsidian-flowershow/styles.css /path/to/obsidian-vault/.obsidian/plugins/flowershow/styles.css
```

5. Reload Obsidian, go to Settings > Community Plugins, and enable the plugin.

### Rebuild on change 

If you want to automatically rebuild the plugin after you make any changes to the source code, run `npm run dev` instead of `npm run build`. This will start a server that will watch for changes to the source files and rebuild the plugin automatically. However, you will still need to reload Obsidian manually each time to see the changes.

### Hot reloading

If you want true hot reloading, i.e. without needing to disable/enable the plugin:

1. Install [Hot-Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin:
  - download the .zip file from the latest release
  - extract the .zip file into your Obsidian vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder
  - go to Settings > Community Plugins and enable the plugin
2. Instead of creating symlinks like in step 4 above, copy the plugin files directly into your Obsidian vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder:

``` sh
mv /path/to/obsidian-flowershow /path/to/obsidian-vault/.obsidian/plugins/
```

3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.

Now, whenever you make any changes to the source code, two things will happen:
1. The plugin will be rebuilt automatically.
2. The Hot-Reload plugin will detect that the plugin has been rebuilt and will reload it in Obsidian.
