# flowershow

## 4.2.0

Require an explicit site name before publishing. Previously an empty site name silently fell back to the vault name, and the existing settings validation was never actually run. The plugin now validates settings at every publish entry point (single note, publish all, and the publish status modal) and blocks publishing with a clear notice until a site name is set.

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 6635b94: Remove unused runtime dependencies left over from the pre-v4 GitHub-publishing era (`axios`, `@octokit/core`, `@octokit/rest`, `@sindresorhus/slugify`, `github-slugger`, `luxon`, and `@types/luxon`). None were imported anywhere; removing them trims install time and supply-chain surface.
- 8600136: Fix published files always showing as "Changed" in the publish status view. The plugin computed a plain `SHA-1` of file content, but the server stores and compares a **git blob** SHA-1 (`SHA-1("blob " + byteLength + "\0" + content)`, matching the CLI and `git hash-object`). The two never matched, so every published file was reported as changed forever. Both `calculateFileSha` and `calculateTextSha` now produce the git blob SHA. No republish is needed after updating — the next status refresh reconciles automatically.

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Preserve backslash-escaped pipes in wikilinks inside tables.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Publish history tracking: the plugin now sends a `publish-id` header with every R2 upload, enabling per-file status tracking and a full publish history in the Flowershow dashboard.

## 4.0.17

### Patch Changes

- Scope checkbox CSS to avoid conflicting with other plugins.

## 4.0.16

### Patch Changes

- 49f41f6: Fix broken internal links when publishing a vault subdirectory — wikilinks, embeds, markdown links, Base query filters, and frontmatter path values are now rewritten to be relative to rootDir

## 4.0.15

- Remove info box about v4 from the plugin options page.

## 4.0.14

## 4.0.13

### Patch Changes

- 60e8515: feat: show publish progress in a Notice instead of the status bar

  Progress is now displayed via a self-updating `Notice` ("⌛ Publishing (X/N)...") that works on both desktop and mobile. The status bar 💐 icon is kept on desktop as a shortcut to open the publish panel. `PublishStatusBar` class has been removed.

## 4.0.12

### Patch Changes

- 0eaa93f: fix: mobile and Windows compatibility improvements
  - Replace `fetch()` with Obsidian's `requestUrl()` in `FlowershowClient` so HTTP requests work on iOS and Android (Capacitor WebView blocks cross-origin `fetch`)
  - Normalize backslashes to forward slashes in `rootDir` and file paths so Windows users with `Notes\subfolder` style settings can publish correctly
  - Guard `addStatusBarItem()` with `Platform.isDesktop` to avoid dead UI code on mobile
